# zipkin-trial[http://zipkin.io/](http://zipkin.io/)[https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools)> Development on Zipkin has continued apace, and since the middle of 2015 it has moved to the openzipkin/zipkin organization at GitHub. There are now bindings for Python, Go, Java, Ruby, Scala and C#; and there are Docker images available for those wanting to get started quickly. We still like this tool. There is an active and growing community around usage of it, and implementation is getting easier. If you need a way of measuring the end-to-end latency of many logical requests, Zipkin continues to be a strong choice.[https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin)## UsageRun zipkin server `docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin`, or start the `zipkin-server` application.Start `client` and `server`, then try to hit [http://localhost:8080/hello/John](http://localhost:8080/hello/John).Then check the zipkin ui [http://localhost:9411/zipkin/](http://localhost:9411/zipkin/).
